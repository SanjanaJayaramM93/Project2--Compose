# Project2--Compose
## Purpose
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The primary goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of a Node.js web application within a Dockerized environment. By utilizing Docker-In-Docker (DinD) technology, this project allows Jenkins to execute Docker commands inside its container, simulating real-world deployment scenarios.
## AWS Sample Node.js Web Application Repository

This project builds upon the AWS Sample Node.js Web Application, which serves as the foundation for our CI/CD pipeline. The repository includes a simple Node.js application that can be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
