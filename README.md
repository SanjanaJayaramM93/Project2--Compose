# üöÄ CI/CD Automation with Dockerized Jenkins: Secure Pipeline for Node.js Web Application Deployment
### üìÖ August 2024 ‚Äì September 2024

## üåü Overview
I developed a fully automated and secure CI/CD pipeline to streamline the deployment of a sample Node.js web application. Leveraging Jenkins and Docker, I ensured efficient build, test, and deployment processes while prioritizing security with tools like Snyk for continuous vulnerability scanning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Highlights

End-to-End Automation: Designed a pipeline using Jenkins and Dockerized environments to automate the entire build and deployment lifecycle.
Docker-In-Docker (DinD) Setup: Configured DinD within a Docker Compose environment, enabling Jenkins to execute Docker commands inside containers seamlessly.
Integrated Security Scanning: Implemented Snyk to perform vulnerability scans, ensuring critical vulnerabilities were identified and resolved before deployment.
Logging and Monitoring: Enabled detailed logging for all build, test, and security scan activities, improving traceability and troubleshooting capabilities.
Version Control with GitHub: Centralized configuration files, Jenkins pipelines, and scripts in GitHub for streamlined collaboration and documentation.
## üí° Technologies & Skills Used

## ‚ú® Impact
This project showcases my expertise in creating secure and efficient DevOps pipelines, containerization, and integrating continuous security measures into automated workflows. It reflects my ability to balance innovation with security and demonstrates proficiency in modern software deployment practices.
## Purpose
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The primary goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of a Node.js web application within a Dockerized environment. By utilizing Docker-In-Docker (DinD) technology, this project allows Jenkins to execute Docker commands inside its container, simulating real-world deployment scenarios.
## AWS Sample Node.js Web Application Repository

This project builds upon the AWS Sample Node.js Web Application, which serves as the foundation for our CI/CD pipeline. The repository includes a simple Node.js application that can be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
